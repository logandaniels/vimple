# vimple
A Safari extension that adds Vim-style keybindings.

This is a clone of extensions like Vimium and Vimari, created partially to add features that Vimari was lacking and partially to improve my knowledge of browser extensions and Javascript.


### Current features
* Link hint navigation!
* Open tab, close tab
* Scroll up, scroll down
* Navigate back and forward in history
* Navigate between adjacent tabs
* Reload page

### Future additions
* Insert mode for temporarily ignoring key bindings, e.g. while interacting with an HTML5 canvas
* Regexp search on page?
* Fuzzy quick search to switch to a particular tab?
* More to come
