# vimple
A Safari extension that adds Vim-style keybindings.

This is a clone of extensions like Vimium and Vimari, created partially to add features that Vimari was lacking and partially to improve my knowledge of browser extensions and Javascript.


### Current features
* Configurable key bindings
* Link hint navigation!
* Open tab, close tab
* Scroll up, scroll down
* Scroll to top or bottom of page
* Navigate back and forward in history
* Navigate between adjacent tabs
* Reload page
* Insert mode for temporarily ignoring key bindings, e.g. while interacting with an HTML5 canvas
* URL blacklist for disabling extension on certain domains

### Future additions
* Regexp search on page?
